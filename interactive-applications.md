## Front-end, simple interface

I strongly recomment what is called minimal css kits

- [spectre css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/elements.html) Good look for data / science type of projects.

## Interactive Dashboard

Codepen has great content, but too often, you end up spending hours exploring it. Another problem is that most of these are likely to be written using some kind of javascript frameworks, so you will have a steep learning curve ahead. Time box it! Writing your own layout using the css kits mentioned is a much safer approach

> There has been very deep reflection on engagement on how to present highly interactive content in that field
