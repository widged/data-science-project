[Photos pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - Free stock photos for commercial use. Has free API that allows you to search photos by keywords.

## Front-end, simple interface

I strongly recomment what is called minimal css kits

- [spectre css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/elements.html) Good look for data / science type of projects.
- [Skeleton framework](https://skeleton-framework.github.io/)
